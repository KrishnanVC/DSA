Graphs:

Adjacency list
Adjacency matrix
List is better for sparse graph and is generally used.
Bfs is better than dfs in some situations.
Dfs of disconnected graph repeat the step on the left over vertices.

In heap implementation of Prims use TreeSet instead of PriorityQueue as Treesset removal os O(log N) while PQ is O(N).
when you want to modify an element in TS just remove the old element and add the modified element.
